Week 0 PAVE assignment

Hi everyone. Excited to get started. As I mentioned in the meeting today, this assignment will range from fairly trivial to somewhat challenging depending on you coding background, but should be very doable for everyone. Feel free to do a simple pixel-search implementation or something fancier with a CNN. Here are the goals:
1. Identify the center and radius of the "buoy" in each image.
2. Make some assumptions about the hardware, then determine the buoys' distances from the camera.
I recommend saving outputs in three lists where centers[0] has tuples of the centers of the buoy for lake0.jpeg, radii[0] has the radius, and distances[0] has the distance in your preferred unit.

If you don't have any image processing experience, my hint is to basically Google search "how to read images into Python", save the images to a directory on your hard drive, and Stackoverflow your way through it. Python is fantastic for image processing.

Let me know if you have any questions. Feel free to work as a team. After this week, we'll create a Slack.
